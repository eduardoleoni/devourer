NodeJS application capable of scraping the whole internet, the only limit is how much information you can store

All you need to do is insert the first website on the scrapping queue, the application will search the website for links and will do the same to the found links, as internet is literally a web (all connected by links), the scrapper won't stop (or will if you feed it with a website that's got no links to other websites lol).
